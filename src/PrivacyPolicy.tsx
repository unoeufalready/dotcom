        <li>Simpson, Homer, that is all.</li>

      <h2>Are you sure though?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes! I have nowhere to put it anyway. That requires a backend and
        thought. I'm just building clients right now. I don't know what your
        browser tracks or what Google Play Store tracks from you downloading an
        app. But I'm not taking any data. Woo hoo!
